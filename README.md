HeisenParse: Intelligent Code Parsing and Visualization System
📌 Project Overview

HeisenParse is an advanced AI-powered system designed to analyze, parse, and visualize source code structures in real time. It helps developers understand complex codebases by generating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and offering a clear structural representation of source code. Developed using C# and WPF, the system provides an interactive graphical interface where users can upload source files, view hierarchical code trees, and regenerate or refactor code dynamically. HeisenParse bridges the gap between traditional text-based coding and visual comprehension, supporting both beginners and experienced developers.

🎯 Key Features

🧩 Automated Code Parsing – Extracts and interprets syntax from multiple programming languages.

🌳 AST Visualization – Displays code logic in a structured, hierarchical tree format.

⚙️ AI-Assisted Analysis – Integrates intelligent suggestions for code optimization.

🧠 Code Regeneration – Supports regeneration of modified or refactored code from visual structures.

💡 User-Friendly WPF Interface – Intuitive design for seamless navigation and visualization.

🔐 Authentication and Session Management – Ensures secure user access and personalized experience.

🧠 Technologies Used

C# / .NET Framework (WPF) – for building cross-platform desktop application

Visual Studio IDE – for UI and backend integration

Python (AI Integration) – for AI-based parsing and regeneration

JSON / XML – for structured data exchange

SQLite / Local Database – for storing project metadata

🔍 How It Works
1. Code Upload and Parsing

Users upload a source code file through the interface.

The system parses the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure.

Key elements like functions, classes, and loops are extracted and mapped.

2. Visualization and Analysis

The AST is rendered visually, allowing users to traverse code hierarchies.

AI-powered analysis provides insights into structure, logic, and dependencies.

3. Code Regeneration

Users can modify nodes or structures within the visual AST.

The system automatically regenerates the corresponding source code, preserving logic and syntax.
